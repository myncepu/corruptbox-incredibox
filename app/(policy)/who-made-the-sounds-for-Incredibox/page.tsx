## The Creative Team

The sounds for Incredibox were created by **Paul Malburet**, better known as **Incredible Polo**. He is one of the three French friends from Saint-Ã‰tienne who created Incredibox in 2009.

## The Development Story

In 2006, three talented individuals came together to create what would become Incredibox:

- **Paul Malburet (Incredible Polo)** - Musician and voice artist
- **Allan Durand** - Director and programmer
- **Romain Delambily** - Graphic designer

They wanted to combine their skills to create an interactive musical experience. The cartoon character in Incredibox is actually a caricature of Incredible Polo himself, who provides all the voices and sounds for the game.

## Musical Evolution

Over the years, Incredible Polo has created unique soundscapes for multiple versions of Incredibox:
